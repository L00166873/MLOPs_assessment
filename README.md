Branching strategy.<br>

Main branch <--- Development branch <--- Feature branches <br>
Main branch: The production branch. What the users will use/are using.<br>
Development branch: Was about to call this a 'staging branch'. Could be used like that... kind of, but they're distinct. Technically.<br>
Feature branches: A branch created specifically for the development of one feature.<br><br>
