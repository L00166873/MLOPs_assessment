Branching strategy.

Main branch <--- Development branch <--- Feature branches
Main branch: The production branch. What the users will use/are using.
Development branch: Was about to call this a 'staging branch'. Could be used like that... kind of, but they're distinct. Technically. All of the new

Feature branches: A branch created specifically for the development of one feature.
